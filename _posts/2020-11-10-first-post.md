# My First Post

This is my first post on this blog site. 

One of the area where I'm working and actively reesearching is the Machine Learning area. 
I've been requested to give this week a webinar for an italian University and one of the subject I want to address is the risk of having Bias in a Machine Learning Model.
I have written an article on the subject and it is published here: (https://luigisaetta.it)

Hope it could be in some way interesting.
